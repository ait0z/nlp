This package is in an inconsistent and experimental state. It basically
supports the management of data for the Bayesian and TFxIDF classifiers.
<h1>Datamining</h1>
<h2>Baysian Filter</h2>
Our initial idea was to use Spam-Filter-Technology to classify requirements. We
use a baysian filter based on Grahams technical articles. Graham describes, how
we could bias the probabilities to increase precision (e.g. counting values of
category "ham" twice). Based on this we experimented with biasing the
probabilities to increase recall (by favoring "sec" values when computing the
baysian probability). Both changes seem to be not beneficial when a good training
set is available. Grahams additions do not have any effect in our testdata, our
additions give good results with a small training set but tend to classify everything
as security relevant with larger ones.
<h2>TFxIDF</h2>
<p>TFxIDF stands for "Term Frequency" multiplied with "Inverse Document Frequency".
It allows to compare and classify a set of documents. It is not really suitable
for requirements classification out of the box. We changed this algorithm and
only use what we identified as the essence of the algorithm.</p>
<p><b>Term Frequency</b> should indicate into what document category (e.g. sec or
nonsec) we should classify the given requirement based on the given term (i.e. a
word of the requirement). We obtained reasonable result by computing
</p><p>
<code>TFsec(t) = sec(t) / (sec(t) + nonsec(t))</code>,
</p><p>

with TFsec being the Term Frequency for category sec, sec(t) being the number of
times t occurred in category sec, and nonsec(t) being the number of time the term
occurred in other categories. </p>
<p><b>Inverse Document Frequency</b> should indicate how important the given word is
for classification. As we understand this, this is a dynamic way to deal with
stopwords. We got reasonable results by computing
</p><p>
<code>IDF(t) = size(R) / size(R(t))</code></p>
</p><p>
with size(R) being the number of all classified requirements (all categories) and
size(R(t)) being the number of all classified requirements (all categories) that
contain t. The value is higher for rare terms.</p>
